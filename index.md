## About Me

Hi, my name is Yunxiang Su (苏云祥). I am currently a fourth Ph.D. student at the [School of Software](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) of Tsinghua University, advised by Professor [Shaoxu Song](https://sxsong.github.io).

My research focuses on DB4AI, particularly database-native machine learning empowered by intrinsic database capabilities, with an emphasis on time-series data. I develop native machine learning algorithms for the open-source time-series database [Apache IoTDB](https://iotdb.apache.org) to enhance the efficiency of data processing and model training. Representative works include autoregressive model learning on LSM storage, native anomaly detection and clustering for time-series data, and robust metrics for time-series validity.
