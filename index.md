## About Me

Hi, my name is Yunxiang Su (苏云祥). I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the [School of Software](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) of Tsinghua University, advised by Professor [Shaoxu Song](https://sxsong.github.io). I receivced my B.S. degree in Mathematics and Physics from the [Department of Physics](https://www.phys.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University.

My research primarily focuses on DB4AI, particularly database-native machine learning empowered by intrinsic database capabilities, with an emphasis on time-series data. I develop native machine learning algorithms for the open-source time-series database [Apache IoTDB](https://iotdb.apache.org) to enhance the efficiency of data processing and model training. Representative works include autoregressive model learning on LSM storage, native anomaly detection and clustering for time-series data, and robust metrics for time-series validity.

I am currently interning at Alibaba's Tongyi Lab, advised by [Rong Zhu](https://redgitcard.github.io/redgitcard/). I am actively exploring the AI4DB field during my internship, with a focus on NL2SQL and leveraging LLM as intrinsic database operators.
